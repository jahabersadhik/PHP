;audiobuffers=32	; The number of 20ms audio buffers to be used
; when feeding audio frames from non-Zap channels
; into the conference; larger numbers will allow
; for the conference to 'de-jitter' audio that arrives
; at different timing than the conference's timing
; source, but can also allow for latency in hearing
; the audio from the speaker. Minimum value is 2,
; maximum value is 32.
